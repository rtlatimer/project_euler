# Project Euler Solutions
by Robert Latimer

### Description

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming.

Each of my solutions are written in Python 2.7. I have decided to tackle these problems to improve my Python coding skills - especially for mathematical and data analysis purposes.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)

### Code

Each file corresponds to a specific problem listed on the Project Euler website.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python problem##.py```

Replace the **##** with the specific problem number you would like to run.
